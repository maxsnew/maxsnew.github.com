<p>I’m a computer scientist working on the foundations of programming languages. My PhD work is on the semantics of sound gradually typed languages: how to design them and how to prove that they support predictable migration from dynamic to static typing. More generally I’m interested in the semantics of safe and secure interoperability between languages, embracing advanced semantic techniques like logical relations and category-theoretic models.</p>
<p>I’m currently a PhD candidate at Northeastern University since Fall 2014, working with <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal/">Amal Ahmed</a>.</p>
<p>I was previously at Northwestern University, where I worked with <a href="http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/">Robby Findler</a> on automated test-case generation.</p>
