* Call-by-push-value: A Lambda Calculus for Effectful Functional Programming

  In this post, I want to introduce you to what is in my opinion the
  best calculus for studying effectful functional programming:
  Call-by-push-value (CBPV). CBPV was introduced by Paul-Blain Levy in
  [[https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pbl/papers/tlca99.pdf][LNCS 1999]] as a "subsuming paradigm" that can be used to unify
  call-by-value (CBV) and call-by-name (CBN) languages under a single
  calculus that is better behaved than either. Whether it was
  operational or denotational semantics, any model for CBV or CBN also
  gave rise to a CBPV model that was simpler to analyze. Long
  advocated by Levy as a great calculus for anyone studying effectful
  functional programming, it's clear that it has caught on at least in
  the more theoretical corners of the programming languages community
  with researchers using it as a tool to help study cost semantics,
  probabilistic programming, gradual typing, effect handlers and
  combining effects with dependent types.

  I often find I have a hard time getting across to my fellow
  researchers just what all the fuss is about. Especially because most
  of them have long written off CBN evaluation altogether and are
  perfectly content to study CBV. But, thinking of CBPV as just a way
  to study CBV and CBN all at once is really selling it short! CBPV is
  useful for so many things and from so many different perspectives.
  1. For type theorists, it's a language that supports effects while
     also having full beta-eta laws for positive and negative types.
  2. For categorically inclined, it relates to Moggi's monadic
     metalanguage the same way that adjunctions relate to
     monads. Maybe we should call it "Levy's adjunctive metalanguage"?
  3. For typed functional programmers, it gives you access to
     well-behaved coinductive types separate from the more familiar
     inductive types.
  4. For language implementers, it provides an alternative to A-normal
     form/Monadic form/CPS with a nice type system that helps reason
     about stack layout, purity and strictness.
  5. For language meta-theorists, it has a simple to analyze
     operational semantics like CPS and its value-stack dichotomy is
     directly applicable to biorthogonal logical relations.

  All of these things make CBPV an ideal calculus to serve as the
  target of elaboration passes for whatever your preferred surface
  language is. But of course, I don't expect you to just take my word
  for it! In future posts I want to dive into to some of the specific
  use-cases of CBPV and synthesize some of the ideas that that are
  spread out across many papers into some more introductory notes. In
  the remainder of this post I want to get across some CBPV basics:
  syntax, typing and operational semantics.

** Implemented Languages Based on CBPV 

   If you're lime me and you love functional programming or just
   trying out interesting languages, you're probably itching to try
   out what programming in a language like CBPV is actually like!
   Andrej Bauer has a simple implementation for education purposes
   called [[http://plzoo.andrej.com/language/levy.html][levy]] in his "PL Zoo" that is probably the best for playing
   with the calculus I've presented here. I have my own Scheme-like
   dynamically typed variant of CBPV called [[https://github.com/maxsnew/modal-scheme][Fiddle]] that is still very
   experimental.

   There aren't really any mature languages that I know of that can be
   considered CBPV proper languages. Since CBPV is very explicit about
   evaluation order like CPS or ANF, there aren't many surface
   languages that follow it exactly it. However, recently designed
   languages that use algebraic effects like [[Frank][]] and [[Eff][]]
   are heavily influenced by CBPV, though they hew more toward
   CBV. And, on the intermediate-language front there is an
   alternative core language for Haskell called [[https://github.com/lukemaurer/sequent-core][Sequent Core]] that is
   based on sequent calculus, which is a very close relative of CBPV.

   If you know of any others, please let me know and I'll add them to
   this list!

** Related Work

   Like most good ideas in computer science, a lot of the ideas in
   CBPV have been independently discovered and pursued in related work
   that goes by other names. CBPV is my preferred flavor of effectful
   calculus, but it is closely related to things like (intuitionistic)
   Sequent Calculi, Linear-non-linear logic, the Enriched Effect
   Calculus, Girard's Ludics and surely many others.
