My advisor Amal Ahmed, on the committee members: 

> Max's dissertation deals with semantic foundations for gradual typing.

> Matthias Felleisen is one of the founders of the area of gradual typing.  I could write lots more!

> Mitch Wand is an expert on PL semantics and types, both critical to this dissertation. 

> Peter Thiemann is an expert on gradual typing and has numerous papers on the topic.

> Dan Licata has been a co-author on two papers with Max on Gradual Type Theory (POPL'19 and FSCD'18) and is an expert on type theory, semantics, and category theory.

> Ron Garcia is an expert on gradual typing (especially well known for the Abstracting Gradual Typing approach which seeks to provide a framework for gradualizing typed languages).  He is also well versed in logical relations and semantic models of types which Max uses in his dissertation.
