I'm currently a computer science PhD student at Northeastern
University since Fall 2014, working with
[Amal Ahmed](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal/).

I did undergrad and masters at Northwestern University, where I worked
with [Robby Findler](http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/).

I have some work on [github](https://github.com/maxsnew).

I like reasonable programming languages.
