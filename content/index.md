# Max S. New

![][max-pic]

I'm a computer scientist working on the foundations of programming
languages.
My main focus is on safe and secure interoperability between
languages.

I'm currently a computer science PhD student at Northeastern
University since Fall 2014, working with
[Amal Ahmed][amal].

I was previously at Northwestern University, where I worked with
[Robby Findler][robby] on automated test-case generation.
