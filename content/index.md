I am a computer scientist working on the foundations of programming
languages. Currently I am a postdoc working with [Dan Licata][dan] at
Wesleyan University. In Fall 2021, I will be an assistant professor at
the [University of Michigan][umich].

My research utilizes mathematical techniques to help in design,
analysis and implementation of programming languages. I am recently
interested in interoperability between languages, especially in the
guises of Gradual Typing and compiler intermediate languages
supporting multiple source languages.

I completed my PhD at Northeastern University in Fall 2020 [Amal
Ahmed][amal]. I was previously at Northwestern University, where I
worked with [Robby Findler][robby] on automated test-case generation.
