[Racket](http://racket-lang.org)

[Redex](http://redex.racket-lang.org/)
-----

For my master\'s research I work with [Robby
Findler](http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/) on automated test
generation for the Redex formal semantics-engineering dsl. It\'s
rolling out with the next release of Racket.

[Elm](http://elm-lang.org)
===

- - -

Elm is a fairly young language, and I\'m working on testing its limits
to help guide future development.

[Lazy](http://github.com/maxsnew/Lazy)
----

I develop and maintain a library for Lazy evaluation and lazy data
structures in the Elm programming language. Elm is a pure strict
language and doesn\'t have built-in support for call-by-need semantics.

[Generic](http://github.com/maxsnew/Generic)
---

This is a library for experimenting with a value-level implementation
of ad-hoc polymorphism (aka overloading). Elm\'s row types are powerful
enough to express something resembling subtyping, but not powerful
enough to express things that require higher-kinded polymorphism (such
as Monads). This library is meant to push the limit of what\'s possible
in Elm and help guide the development of new language features.
