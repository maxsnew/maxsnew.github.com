title: Infinitesimal Types

There's a notion of derivative of a type that looks very cool and
makes nice blog posts.

The slogan is "the derivative of a type is its one hole contexts"

However most people are not familiar with any more than this
intuition.
Can we define the derivative of a type by its properties than by fiat?

There is certainly hope for this because this structural derivative
operation is *not* limited to datatypes, it also appears in the theory
of combinatorial species, which is an algebraic theory of
combinatorial structures.
