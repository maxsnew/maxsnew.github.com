Top --> Set as a type refinement system.

One thing that trips students up in an introductory point-set topology
class is the product topology.

Topology books usually present 2 constructions the "box" topology and
the true product topology.
When you're young and naive the box topology looks nicer but the
product topology is the one you want because it's an actual categorical
product.

The only reason, I think, for this preference is because of how
uncategorical your point-set topology book is, with a focus on
manipulating bases and sub-bases and on and on.

However if we instead view topology with a focus on the fibration Top
--> Set, then the product topology construction is an example of a
very generally useful construction of product spaces.

## Top --> Set fibration

...

then the product space of A and B is just

	pi_1^*(A) /\ pi_2^*(B)

which fits the characterization you eventually hear that it's the
"coarsest topology making the projections continuous".
